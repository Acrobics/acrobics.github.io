<marquee scrollamount="12">STOP. POSTING. ABOUT AMONG US! I'm TIRED of seeing it! My friends on TikTok send me memes, on Discord it's f***ing memes. I was in a server, right? And ALL of the channels are just Among Us stuff. I showed my Champion Underwear to my girlfriend and the logo, I flipped it, and said "Hey babe, when the underwear is sus! HAHA! DING DING DING DING DING DING DING, DING DING DING!" I looked at a trash can and I said, "That's a bit SUSSY!" I look at my PENIS, I think of the astronaut's HELMET, and I say PENIS? MORE LIKE PEEN-SUS!!! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH</marquee>
